# In some situations, it may be useful to categorize variable, i.e., a different division into categories
# than would result from the data.
# a) Generate 100 observations that are the answers to the survey questions, each answer can take
#    one of the values: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'.
# b) Categorize the obtained observations so that category 1 includes 'a' and 'b' responses,
#   category 2 'c' and 'd' responses, and category 3 'e' response.
